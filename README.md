# Warning Signs

Project for the [ATHack](http://assistivetech.mit.edu/athack/) 2016 hackathon focusing on innovative solutions to problems surrounding human trafficking. Warning Signs is a simple survey that allows concerned parties to assess whether young people are at risk of being trafficked. The results of the quiz dictate suggestions for resources and assistance.
